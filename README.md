Description: We are coding in Python and will be using niceGUI for our interface. Our project will take in text and color code the text based on its syntax. For example, all the keywords like ‘int, if, when’ would be the same color. 

Objectives: One of our goals is to have the users’ code dynamically highlighted for quick assistance. Another goal of ours is to have a sidebar where users can see the meaning and role the highlighted word plays. Our last goal is to create a clean, readable, easily accessible user interface.
